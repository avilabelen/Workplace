Make a Class
------------

Q1. What’s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. s a programming practice where you use the const keyword to declare 
variables, pointers, and function parameters as constant — meaning their
value or the object they point to cannot be modified. It is important because
prevents accidental modification, works with pointers to prevent unsafe modifications,
supports safer interfaces and improves code readability.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. To determine if a class is const-correct, check how the const keyword is used: 
functions that don't modify the object's data should be marked as const, 
parameters and return types should use const to avoid unnecessary copies 
or accidental modifications, and pointers/references should be used with const to prevent
 modifying the pointed-to data or the pointer itself when not needed.
